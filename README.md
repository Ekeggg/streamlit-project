# Overview

This streamlit application displays the results of a clustering analysis of temperature anomalies based on ENSO conditions (El Niño and La Niña). 

# Data

Data from Berkeley Earth was used for this project. This data provides temperature anomalies on each land coordinate every month in NetCDF format. The data can be found [here]([url](https://berkeley-earth-temperature.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Global/Gridded/Complete_TAVG_LatLong1.nc)).

# Features

This streamlit project consists of an interactive map that displays the cluster a particular coordinate point belongs to and the average temperature anomaly for that coordinate in El Niño and La Nina, and a table that displays the average temperature anomaly for each ENSO condition for each cluster. 

# How to reproduce

This streamlit project can be found at ensoanomalyclustering.streamlit.app.
